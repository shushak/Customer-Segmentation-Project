# **Customer Segmentation: Unsupervised Machine Learning**
### 👩‍💻👩‍💻 **Group members**: Shushan Hakobyan, Mercedes Santana Rodriguez
#### 🔭 **Objective**: The aim of the project is to perform customer segmentation analysis using a dataset from a retail store. Customer segmentation is a common technique to group customers in different segments based on similar characteristics. We can segment customers based on their buying behavior on the market. As we have a huge dataset, we will use machine learning algorithms to perform customer clustering. We will cluster customers on segments based on their behavior using the K-Means algorithm.

#### 📈 **Data**: The data set consists of 2240 raws, 29 columns. The dataset is from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). The variables and their description are provided below:

#### **People**

##### ID: Customer's unique identifier
##### Year_Birth: Customer's birth year
##### Education: Customer's education level
##### Marital_Status: Customer's marital status
##### Income: Customer's yearly household income
##### Kidhome: Number of children in customer's household
##### Teenhome: Number of teenagers in customer's household
##### Dt_Customer: Date of customer's enrollment with the company
##### Recency: Number of days since customer's last purchase
##### Complain: 1 if the customer complained in the last 2 years, 0 otherwise

#### **Products**

##### MntWines: Amount spent on wine in last 2 years
##### MntFruits: Amount spent on fruits in last 2 years
##### MntMeatProducts: Amount spent on meat in last 2 years
##### MntFishProducts: Amount spent on fish in last 2 years
##### MntSweetProducts: Amount spent on sweets in last 2 years
##### MntGoldProds: Amount spent on gold in last 2 years

#### **Promotion**

##### NumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases made with a discount
##### AcceptedCmp1: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise
##### AcceptedCmp2: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise
##### AcceptedCmp3: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise
##### AcceptedCmp4: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise
##### AcceptedCmp5: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise
##### Response: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise

##### **Place**

##### NumWebPurchases: Number of purchases made through the company’s website
##### NumCatalogPurchases: Number of purchases made using a catalogue
##### NumStorePurchases: Number of purchases made directly in stores
##### NumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to company’s website in the last month

#### 🔬 **Methodology**: We will cluster customers on segments based on their behavior using the K-Means algorithm in Python. Tableau and Python are the primary tools for the data analysis and visualization. Also, Trello and GitHub will be used for project planning and management.

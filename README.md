# **Final-Project**: Customer segmentation study
### **Group members**: Mercedes Santana Rodriguez, Shushanik Hakobyan
#### **Objective**: The aim of the project is to perform customer segmentation analysis using a dataset from a retail store. Customer segmentation is a common technique to group customers in different segments based on similar characteristics. We can segment customers based on their buying behavior on the market. As we have a huge dataset, we will use machine learning algorithms to perform customer clustering. We will cluster customers on segments based on their behavior using the K-Means algorithm in Python.

#### **Data**: The data set consists of 2240 raws, 29 columns. The dataset is from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). The variables and their description are provided below:
